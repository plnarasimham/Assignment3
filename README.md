This is the repo for Assignment 3
2 python scripts are attached to this repo

Vectorized.py - has code for the 1st task where we need to compute the parameters using just formula and linear algebra.
Task2.py - has code for finding the optimal parameters using gradient descent.
Both these print output on the console and do not create an output folder.

My cluster on the google cloud got deleted before I could pull the record for how much time the code ran and the stages. So, I do not have those screenshots from spark history.

Run the .py files by submitting the task to spark-submit
